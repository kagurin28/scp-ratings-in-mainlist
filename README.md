# SCP Ratings in Mainlist
This extension shows the ratings of SCPs in the mainlist pages. This makes it far easier to find good articles without having to actually click on the link and go to the article to see the rating.
## What browsers does this work on?
I have only tested this on Firefox, but I am assuming that it would work on most browsers.
## To Do list
- Make it work properly on the SCP-001 page
- Make it work on all the canon and GOI hubs
